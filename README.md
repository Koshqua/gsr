## go-server-reload ##
### A very simple reloader for go servers ###
This app will track all changes in the root directory it was launched from. 
And if change was made on .go file it will reload the server. 
It prints standart output and standart error from app you are launching it on.

To install `go get github.com/Koshqua/gsr`.



*To start tracking and run app you should write command `gsr run filename.go`.
*To exit the process, just write `x` to the terminal. 

In closest future i'll make the code more beatiful :)
